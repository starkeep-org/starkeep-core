# @starkeep/app-client

## 0.10.2

### Patch Changes

- 45d64d3: `createDataProxyHandler` refuses a request whose `Sec-Fetch-Site` is `cross-site` or `same-site` with 403, before any session check or credential load. A `GET` or `HEAD` navigation from another site still passes, because following a link writes nothing. On the local surface a page on another site could otherwise send the proxy a blind `no-cors` POST and have it signed. A request without the header, from a server, a script or a phone, passes as before.

## 0.10.1

### Patch Changes

- d13e7ee: The session routes' cross-origin check also accepts the host the browser is on, as the distribution's `x-starkeep-viewer-host` header names it. Session refresh and sign-out now work on a custom domain as well as on the `cloudfront.net` name.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 18b7a5f: Cloud app sign-in moves to Cognito's managed login page, so app code never sees a password. The platform's `/auth/start`, `/auth/callback` and `/auth/sign-out` routes set each app's `sk_session` and `sk_token` cookies at that app's path. The `@starkeep/app-client/session-cookies` subpath exports `signInAddress`, `signOutAddress` and the cookie names, with no dependencies.

  Breaking: `initiateAuth`, `respondNewPassword` and `InitiateResult` are gone from `@starkeep/app-client/auth`, and the session routes no longer accept a password. A cloud app's server mints its user token from the session cookie with `mintIdToken`, which now uses the cloud-apps client.

## 0.9.1
