### Minor Changes

- Publish the engine changes made since the 0.4 package set (2026-08-02) and the 0.3 set (2026-07-29), which went unpublished: sync in bounded rounds with a delta scan, and the residency fixes; content-addressed shared records keyed on parent, filename and hash; metadata that syncs with its record; the shared query grammar; stand-ins and the reduced storage settings; record deletion, the deleted feed and blob reclamation; rows that travel ahead of their files; and per-user object keys, user-scoped cloud statements and device sign-in. Most of these change the wire format or the stored layout, so every node must run this set together.
