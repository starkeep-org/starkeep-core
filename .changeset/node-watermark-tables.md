The DSQL adapter and applier read sync coverage from per-author watermark tables instead of grouping every row the user owns. `shared.node_watermarks_records`, `shared.node_watermarks_labels` and each app schema's `_starkeep_node_watermarks` hold, per user, author and type or table, the highest `updated_at` that has landed. Every write to a synced table now runs in a transaction that raises its authors' entries from the rows it wrote. An entry never decreases, so an author whose rows were all superseded keeps its coverage. Each adapter and applier instance reads each table once until its next write.

`guardNodeWatermarks` wraps a client and refuses a synced write outside a transaction, a commit that skipped its raise, any other write to the watermark tables, and savepoints. A type-scoped adapter narrows the watermark tables by type, as it narrows records and labels. The owner scope now accepts an `insert … select` into an owned table and selects the user in the owner column. An installed app whose watermark table is missing throws from `getNodeWatermarks`, so the exchange reports incomplete coverage rather than none. The DSQL bytes-watermark store's `save` now replaces the stored map, as the memory store does, by deleting the rows of authors the map omits.

`shared-space-api` exports `NODE_WATERMARKS_TABLE` and reserves the name. `storage-adapter` replaces `buildLabelNodeWatermarks` with `buildNodeWatermarks`, which serves the grouped reads SQLite still uses. The type scope narrows labels by their denormalized `record_type` instead of a semi-join to records.
