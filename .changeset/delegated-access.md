Outside clients, such as MCP clients and scripts, can reach one app's data with a delegation token the user creates on the platform's consent page. A manifest route declares `"auth": "delegated"` for such a client, and `verifyDelegation(req)` in `@starkeep/app-client` tells the route whose request it is. Pass the returned token to `signedFetch` (`delegation`) or `proxyToDataServer` (`delegationToken`) so the platform applies the token's mode and revocation to each data call. On the local surface a loopback caller passes with no token.

The manifest validator refuses `auth: "public"` on a handler or a route, and accepts a `publicPaths` entry only when it is a platform page or one of the handler's `staticAssetPaths`. A manifest that used either must move the route to `"delegated"` or drop it.
